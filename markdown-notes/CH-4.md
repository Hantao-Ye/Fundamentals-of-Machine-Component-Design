## 4-1 Springs

### Definition

A mechanical element that exerts a force when deformed. If we designate the general relationship between force and deflection by the equation

**spring rate**

$$
k(y) = \frac{\mathrm{d}F}{\mathrm{d}y}
$$

- k is constant for linear force-deflection problems

## 4-2 Deflection Due to Bending

the curvature of a beam subjected to a bending moment M is given by

$$
\frac{1}{\rho} = \frac{M}{EI}
$$

where $\theta = \frac{\mathrm{d}y}{\mathrm{d}x}$

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \frac{M}{EI} &= \frac{\mathrm{d}^2y}{\mathrm{d}x^2}\\[2ex]
    \frac{V}{EI} &= \frac{\mathrm{d}^3y}{\mathrm{d}x^3}\\[2ex]
    \frac{q}{EI} &= \frac{\mathrm{d}^4y}{\mathrm{d}x^4}\\[2ex]
\end{aligned}
$$

### Ex 4-1

Determine the equation for the slope and deflection of the beam, the slopes at the ends, and the max deflection

$$
\begin{aligned}
    M = \frac{wl}{2}x-\frac{w}{2}x^2\\[2ex]
\end{aligned}
$$
